## Overview

**Riemannian geometry** studies smooth manifolds, multi-dimensional curved spaces with peculiar geometries endowed with non-Euclidean metrics. In these spaces Riemannian geometry allows the definition of **angles**, **geodesics** (shortest path between two points), **distances** between points, **centers of mass** of several points, etc.

In several fields of research such as *computer vision* and *brain-computer interface*, treating data in the **manifold of positive definite matrices** has allowed the introduction of machine learning approaches with remarkable characteristics, such as simplicity of use, excellent classification accuracy, as demonstrated by the [winning score](http://alexandre.barachant.org/challenges/) obtained in six international data classification competitions, and the ability to operate transfer learning (Congedo et *al.*, 2017a, Brachant et *al.*, 2012)[ðŸŽ“](@ref).

In this package we are concerned with making use of Riemannian Geometry for classifying data in the form of positive definite matrices (e.g.,
[covariance matrices](https://github.com/mateuszbaran/CovarianceEstimation.jl), [Fourier cross-spectral matrices](https://marco-congedo.github.io/FourierAnalysis.jl/dev/crossspectra/
), etc.).
This can be done in two ways: either directly in the **manifold of positive definite matrices** using Riemannian machine learning methods or in the **tangent space**, where traditional (Euclidean) machine learning methods apply
(*i.e.*, linear discriminant analysis, support-vector machine,
logistic regression, random forest, etc.).

**Figure 1**

*Schematic representation of Riemannian classification. Data points are either natively positive definite matrices or are converted into this form. The classification can be performed by Riemannian methods in the manifold of positive definite matrices or by Euclidean methods after projection onto the tangent space.*

Currently implemented models are:

**Acting on the manifold of PD matrices**
- the Riemannian *minimum-distance to mean* (MDM).

**Acting on the tangent space**
- *elastic-net logistic regression* (ENLR), including the pure *Lasso* and pure *Ridge* logistic regression;
- *support-Vector machine* (SVM), including *C-Support Vector Classification* (C-SVC), *nu-SVC*, *one-class SVC*, *Epsilon Support-Vector Regression** (SVR) and *nu SVR**.

For a formal introduction to the manifold of positive definite matrices
the reader is referred to the monography written by Bhatia(2007)[ðŸŽ“](@ref).

For an introduction to Riemannian geometry and an overview of mathematical tools implemented in the [PostDefManifold](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifold.jl/latest/) package, which is used here, see [Intro to Riemannian Geometry](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifold.jl/latest/introToRiemannianGeometry/).
