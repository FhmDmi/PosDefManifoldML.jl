# Give two symmetric positive definite matrices A and B,
# 80 marices will be created randomly as points on the the geodesic
# relying A to B and 80 marices as points on the the geodesic relying B to A,
# for 80 arc-lengths given by function rand(Float64)*exp(-i/(160))),
# for 1=1:80. This makes 80 two class problems with 160 observations each
# that must be progressively better separable as i increases.
# For each of three default machine learning models (MDM, ENLR and SVM)
# the average accuracy is found by a 10-fold cross-validation for each i
# dataset. The Pearson correlation of the accuracy with the vector [1 2...80]
# is computed and a statistical test on the probability that the correlation is
# equal to zero is performed, requesting the p-value be <1e-8
# (i.e., the correlation with 80-2 degrees of freedom must be > 0.6)

# This is not a formal test, but a general test on the functioning of all
# main functions of the packages and on the expected behavior of ML models.
